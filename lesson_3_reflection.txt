Slide 10 :
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Well I said before that when I pull changes manually. It will be more accurate and efficiant.

Slide 13 :
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks for getting repasotory from gitHub servers it self.
clones to get repasotory from gitHub server to my local computer.
branches to follow the parent path of the files in the repasotory.

Slide 22 :
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

I don't know.

Slide 25 :
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Well I will have to send the whole project by mail or bu uploading
it to the cloud. or sharing it by using USB.

OfCourse using git and hithub will make everything easier and faster.

the old way would be harder ofcourse.

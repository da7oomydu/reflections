Slide 10 :
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Well I said before that when I pull changes manually. It will be more accurate and efficiant.

Slide 13 :
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks for getting repasotory from gitHub servers it self.
clones to get repasotory from gitHub server to my local computer.
branches to follow the parent path of the files in the repasotory.

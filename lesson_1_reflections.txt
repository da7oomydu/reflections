Well fiff helped by
1 - saving a lot of my time.
2 - find the difference without any error.
3 - very accurate. 

for slide 8 :
Well by seeing my errors and how I solved it. It will give so much experiance.

for slide 15 :
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions
automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Well I thinks the pros is :
- Working offline.
- Manually saving.
- Working with anyeditor.

And the cons are :
- can't explain the differences if the most of the text are 
written in the same line.

for slide 18 :
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git,
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, 
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Well to keep track of the changes for the mutual files.


for slide 22 :
How can you use the commands git log and git 
diff to view the history of files?

Well after cloaning the project I can use git log to see all the
id and the main changes that have been made. 
after that by using git diff I can compare to id to know the 
all the difference between two files.

for slide 26 :
How might using version control make you more confident to make
changes that could break something?

Well without git when I do the changes I would be worry that
something might happened to the code. But with git I will have
all the convidence that I need to change whatever I want 
because I know that I can discover the errors with one order.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

for comparing my android projects code.
